# Infrastructure detection from satellite images

This project is based on data from the SpaceNet 7 challenge, called Multi-Temporal Urban
Development. The goal is to solve (using solely satellite imagery) two different tasks: building
detection and change detection.
The former consist in identifying where buildings are in a satellite image. The latter consist in
spotting differences, in terms of buildings, between two images of the same area at two different
months.

The code is in the jupyter notebooks and detailed description of the project in the report pdf.
